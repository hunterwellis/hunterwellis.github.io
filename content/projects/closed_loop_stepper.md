This is a design for a stepper motor I made during my Junior year of undergrad at Virginia Tech. 
It was my first real exposure to PCB design and was definetly a bit ambitious for my skill level at the time. Due to the [COVID chip shortage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932023_global_chip_shortage) I never completely finished the project.
