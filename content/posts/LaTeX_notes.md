After graduating with my Bachelors from Virginia Tech in 2024 I had an internship doing Thrust Vector Controls at the [Marshall Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/marshall/). While working in the TVC branch it was necessary to draw on much of the knowledge I had learned in my control systems courses from my undergraduate studies – this meant referencing textbooks and trying to track down lecture notes, which costed me lots of time and headache.

In an effort to avoid the same fate for my graduate studies, I decided to begin taking notes digitally. This takes a bit more time and effort than traditional pen an paper note taking, but these notes should last me throughout my career.
The formatting of my notes is heavily based on [SeniorMars' LaTeX template](https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/main/latex_template).

Here are some of the notes I have taken so far:
